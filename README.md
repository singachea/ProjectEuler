# Project Euler

This is pretty much about solving problems in different languages according to my mood. Obviously some problems are solved just for the sake of touching languages' features.

## Problem List

 * Problem 001: [java](java/src/Problem001.java)
 * Problem 002: [java](java/src/Problem002.java)
 * Problem 003: [ruby](ruby/Problem003.rb)
 * Problem 004: [elixir](elixir/Problem004.exs)
 * Problem 005: [javascript](javascript/Problem005.js)
 * Problem 006: [python](python/Problem006.py)
 * Problem 007: [scala](scala/src/Problem007.scala)
 * Problem 008: [elixir](elixir/Problem008.exs)
 * Problem 009: [python](python/Problem009.py)
 * Problem 010: [scala](scala/src/Problem010.scala) (this problem is simple, but very interesting!)
 * Problem 011: [scala](scala/src/Problem011.scala)
 * Problem 012: [ruby](ruby/Problem012.rb) (simple, but also interesting!)
 * Problem 013: [ruby](ruby/Problem013.rb)
